tests/managers/test_pending_handlers.py
---------------------------------------
Handlers for interactive pending actions: deletion, registration, and event creation.
They use the global PendingActions state, which is concurrency-safe.
Now includes concurrency tests for event creation with multiple senders and also
for the same sender providing multiple event details in parallel.

NEW/CHANGED:
  - Added test_concurrent_event_creation_same_user to simulate a single user
    providing multiple sets of event creation data concurrently, ensuring no crashes
    or partial writes.
