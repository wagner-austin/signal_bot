managers/volunteer/volunteer_operations.py --- Volunteer operations.
Provides functions for volunteer registration, checkâ€‘in, and deletion.
Uses a centralized sign_up method for consistent volunteer creation/updates.
Changes:
 - Use 'external_connection=True' in repository calls to avoid closing a shared connection during sign_up.
 - Add per-phone locking to prevent race conditions during concurrent sign-ups.
