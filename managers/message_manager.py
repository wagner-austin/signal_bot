---------------------------
Aggregated message manager facade.
Provides a unified interface for processing incoming messages by delegating to the message dispatcher.

CHANGES:
 - If no recognized command is found, auto-dispatch to the user's active_flow (if any).
 - Minimal changes otherwise, preserving existing logic and docstrings.
